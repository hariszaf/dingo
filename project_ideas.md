# Leveraging the increased statistical value of flux sampling

## Overview

The project will introduce new features for further statistical analysis of the samples and visualizations generated by `dingo`.

These will include at least the following features: 
- inference of pairwise correlated reactions
- construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights
- annotation of these weights to the metabolic model and extraction to an annotated SBML file


All methods will be implemented in Python and merged in the `dingo` library.

The contributor will also run experiments with several metabolic networks to investigate the scaling of their findings.


## Related work

In constraint-based metabolic modelling, physical and biochemical constraints define a polyhedral convex set of feasible flux vectors. 

Contrary to Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), flux sampling is not dependent on an objective function [1]. 
Thus, sampling of this set provides an unbiased characterization of the metabolic capabilities of a biochemical network. 
Moreover, by sampling a sufficient number of samples one can study the properties of certain components of the whole network and deduce significant biological insights such as correlated reactions and/or pathways and more.

To sample uniformly from a convex polytope, `dingo` uses Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling method based on Billiard walk [2].

Metabolic models are usually in SBML format and can be visualized through [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org).

## Details of your coding project

The contributor will have to initiate the a post-process statistical analysis of the returned samples.
Then, they will extend dingo's [`illustrations.py`](https://github.com/GeomScale/dingo/blob/develop/dingo/illustrations.py) to visualize reaction pairs found correlated.
Both [Plotly](https://plotly.com) and [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12.4/index.html) libraries will be considered. 

Then they will have to run a few experiments on benchmark metabolic networks to assess how their methods scale in real-world metabolic networks and write a brief report with the results.

Difficulty: Medium


## Expected impact

The project will provide great help in the interpretation of the sampling findings. 
This benefits both the biologists community as they would gain novel insight and the geometry community highlighting the added value of the random sampling methods.
Also, it brings together GeomScale Org. with the NRNB community supporting Cytoscape.

# Metabolic interactions inference using community flux sampling

## Overview
 
The project will enhance `dingo` by incorporating various approaches for modeling microbial communities and conducting sampling in their flux space.

These will include at least: 
- a bag-of-reactions model: the union of all reactions and metabolites within at least one model of the community members 
- a bag of genomes model: each member of the community is depicted as a separate compartment, and their interactions are facilitated by shuttle reactions.


Flux sampling will be then conducted using the supported samplers within the `dingo` framework with or without a 
ginen set of elementary conversion modes.
The latter, would focus on the exchange reactions of the community model.

Cross-feeding interactions will be inferred from the samples based on the 
dependencies between fluxes of the pair.

The results obtained will undergo validation against experimental data. 
A comparative analysis of the employed modeling approaches will be performed.


## Related work

Community Genome-Scale models have been used for some time now [1].
Yet, there are several ways to model a community; each of whom having their own pros and cons [2]. 
Random flux sampling has become feasible for GEMs in recent years [3], but to scale pathway analysis it is necessary to focus on a subset of pathways or a subnetwork of the full metabolic network.

All features build is going to be in Puthon.
Methods such as `ecmtool` will be investigated to get elementary conversion modes.
All methods and analyses will be performn in Python.

Methods such as `ecmtool` will be investigated to get elementary conversion modes.


Already implemented algorithms, regarding both the creation of the community model and the enumeration of the conversion modes will be considered for that, 
e.g. (/exchange-enumeration/multicellular_analysis_ove.ipynb)(https://gitlab.com/YlvaKaW/exchange-enumeration/-/blob/main/multicellular_analysis_ove.ipynb)



Difficulty: Hard



## Expected impact

The scientific impact of this project could be fundamental.
Only recently was explained how flux sampling when focusing on exchange reactions, could be implemented in community models.
This will be the first implementation of this feature in Python and in large scale.
